    <h2>How to Prepare Cream of Broccoli soup</h2>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a medium stock pot over medium heat. Saute onion and celery until tender.</li>
        <li>Add broccoli and broth, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use an immersion blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a small saucepan over medium to medium-low heat; stir in flour and add milk. Stir until thick and bubbly, and add to soup. Season with pepper and serve.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
