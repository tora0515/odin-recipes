        <h2><span>Description</span></h2>
        <p>
          Shogayaki is a popular stir-fry Japanese dish. It features thinly sliced pork marinated in ginger and soy sauce. The dish is often served with a side of shaved cabbage, a dipping mayonnaise, and a small bowl of rice. Shogayaki was the first Japanese dish I learned to cook while living in Tokyo and has become my go-to showoff for friends and family.
