# odin-recipes
A basic HTML only website for recipes.

I will practice using HTML from The Odin Project's Foundations Course. 

Self reflection:

Wins:
- Able to navigate folders and create files through the terminal without reference to notes.
- Could create a basic HTML boilerplate from scratch without reference to notes.
- Was able to include all HTML tags studied.

Needs Improvement:
- Basic git commands:  I was not able to move the repository to my local machine without referencing previous chapters.
- Relied on git command lesson to add and commit files
- Not comfortable writing commit messages. Will need more practice.
- Needed notes to include ref="noopener noreferrer".

**Update 1**

Started on the assignment for "The Cascade" section of the Foundation course. Was able to complete the index.html page styling.

Positives:
- Could add may styles covered in the text.
- Was able to mimic an image of a recipe book contents page without the use of chrome tools

Needs Improvement:
- Used repetitive styles and needed to spend time removing redundancies from the stylesheet.
- Went over scope by using styles that have not yet been covered. Not completely sure they are applied correctly or efficiently.
