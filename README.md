# odin-recipes
A basic HTML only website for recipes.

I will practice using HTML from The Odin Project's Foundations Course. 

Self reflection:

Wins:
- Able to navigate folders and create files through the terminal without reference to notes.
- Could create a basic HTML boilerplate from scratch without reference to notes.
- Was able to include all HTML tags studied.

Needs Improvement:
- Basic git commands:  I was not able to move the repository to my local machine without referencing previous chapters.
- Relied on git command lesson to add and commit files
- Not comfortable writing commit messages. Will need more practice.
- Needed notes to include ref="noopener noreferrer".

**Update 1**

Started on the assignment for "The Cascade" section of the Foundation course. Was able to complete the index.html page styling.

Positives:
- Could add may styles covered in the text.
- Was able to mimic an image of a recipe book contents page without the use of chrome tools

Needs Improvement:
- Used repetitive styles and needed to spend time removing redundancies from the stylesheet.
- Went over scope by using styles that have not yet been covered. Not completely sure they are applied correctly or efficiently.

**Update 2**

Finished the "The Cascade" section assignment by styling the recipes pages.

Positives:
- I created a second style sheet and linked it after the original. I was able to update styles in the index stylesheet to fit the recipes pages.
- Tried to learn how to use containers.

Needs Improvement:
- I am still not sure how to correctly use containers. This can be seen in the recipes pages:
  - Shogayaki 'main' container does not have margin between the top of the container and the browser bar. The other 2 pages do
  - I think this has to do with how I am handling height. I chose html,body to be '100%' while the main container had 'Auto'.
  - I was having an issue with either:
    - The main container working like the index page but having inner div text spill outside of it; or
    - Having the main container height increase/decrease to fit the inner div text but have the top margin issue above.

**Update 3**

Finished the "Block and Inline" lesson. Updated the index.html sheet to include styles from the lesson.

Positives:
- Was able to reduce the number of css classes needed in the index tab.
- Could use display: inline-block and inherit for some styles
- Reduce duplication in original css file

Needs Improvement:
- Still relying on google for simple style commands.
- Wasn't able to incorporate all new commands learned.
