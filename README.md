# odin-recipes
A basic HTML only website for recipes.

I will practice using HTML from The Odin Project's Foundations Course. 

Self reflection:

Wins:
- Able to navigate folders and create files through the terminal without reference to notes.
- Could create a basic HTML boilerplate from scratch without reference to notes.
- Was able to include all HTML tags studied.

Needs Improvement:
- Basic git commands:  I was not able to move the repository to my local machine without referencing previous chapters.
- Relied on git command lesson to add and commit files
- Not comfortable writing commit messages. Will need more practice.
- Needed notes to include ref="noopener noreferrer".
